//Unlike java, files and the class itself can have different names.
//e.g. this file is called: "G03_Classes" but the containing class is "AngryBirds"
//But is recommended to follow same name for convention.

class AngryBirds {

}

//Also there might be more than one class declared
class Bird{}
class Pig{}
// A file with no classes is basically a script.
